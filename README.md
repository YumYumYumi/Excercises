When people hear the word "deforestation" or "illegal logging", tropical forests in south-east Asia and Amazon rainforest are the first things popped up in their heads. However, this is not the only story of Asia or South America. (And Let's think about who has real responsibility for the deforestation)
Since Romania became the part of European Union, the illegal logging in Carpathian started. 
The Carpathian Mountains constitute Europe's largest temperate forest ecosystems and are only primary forests within the EU (outside of Scandinavia) and a biodiversity hotspot. The deforestation increased especially between 2001 and 2011 when Australian wood processing companies like Schweighofer, Egger and Kronospan dominated the market. According to "Global Forest Watch" 317,000 hectares of Romanian forest were vanished between 2001 and 2017.  

*(My result animation shows just a small part of clear cut area in Carpathian. And the time period on the animation is interpolated and does not correspond to the real time period so cannot be analyzed as real values)*
